Sōta discovers that other characters from different stories and forms of media were also brought to the real world, with some of them aligned with the military uniform princess, who promised them the ways to end the strife in their worlds and a way back home, unaware of her true intentions. To stop the military uniform princess from bringing destruction to every world that exists, Sōta agrees to find the other characters and bring them home.</p>
